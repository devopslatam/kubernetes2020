# Kubernetes Workshop 2020

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/devopslatam/kubernetes2020.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/devopslatam/kubernetes2020)

This repository contains instructions and sample code for the Kubernetes Workshop.

The folder `sample-app` contains a sample dotnet core application for the containerization workshop. 

The folder `terraform-sample` contains sample terraform code to provision 3 servers on Google Compute Engine. These are used to demonstrate the manual provision and configuration of the cluster.

Each one of the lab folders contains instructions that should be executed by each group in the breakaway rooms time.

The .travis.yml is place to showcase a simple way to implement Continuous Integration.
